        <h3> THE SCHOLAR'S 4 JEWELS</h3>
        <p> As a cultural label representing thousands of years of Chinese history, the “scholar's four jewels” of China are known as Chinese writing brush, ink stick, ink slab and paper. With the decline of handwriting, Chinese traditional craftsmanship is disappear from our daily lives. We don't need everyone knows how to make them, but we wish more people understand and remember them.</p></div>

        <h3>BLUE CALICO DRESSES </h3>
        <p> “Blue dye comes from the indigo plant but is even bluer.” The vido showed the steps to make it. Plant the indigo seeds and harvest twice a year. Squash the leaves in a tank of liquid, drain to extract the dye, hand print the cloth and make into clothes! Blue calico dying and batik printing are time-honored crafts handed down through generations. This cultural heritage should be remembered.</p></div>

        <h3>A SELF-MADE SWING </h3>
        <p> This is the first video of her that I watched and I'm really impressed by her proficient skills. In this video, she made a wooden swing using a broken wooden sofa totally by herself. After watching this video, I staretd to follow her channel and I really enjoy all her videos. Her videos showed some charming elements of the rural villages in China which people do not usually see. </p></div>

       <h3>SALT-MAKING PROCESS </h3>
       <p> Firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and tea are the seven essentials for Chinese to start a day. One can’t live without salt. Legend goes that the tribal leader Susha “boiled the sea water to get salt”, and then did we have varieties of it from the sea, lakes, and wells. It is as trivial as a kitchen seasoning, and as vital as a nation’s economic lifeline. From a grain of salt, one may take a glimpse of the Chinese history.</p></div>
